## Introduction

<hr>

Importing or reading data from different sources and file formats is one of the
basic and crucial stages of any data analysis project. In this tutorial, you 
will learn to read data into R, examine the different challenges and address
them using the appropriate methods.

### What will I learn?

<hr>

In this module, we will learn to read data from:

- xls
    - list sheets in an excel file
    - read data from an excel sheet
    - read specific cells
    - read specific rows
    - read specific columns
- other statistical softwares
    - SAS
    - SPSS
    - STATA


## List Sheets

<hr>

An excel workbook may contain more than 1 sheet. We need to know the name of 
the sheets in order to read the data. `excel_sheets()` will return the names 
of all the sheet in the workbook. For example, the below code will return the 
names of all the sheets in the file `xyx.xls`.

### Syntax

<hr>

```{r import55-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE}
excel_sheets('folder_path/xyz.xls')
```

<br>

#### Instructions

<hr>

- list the sheets in the workbook `sample.xls`
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`

```{r import55, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'List Sheets', exercise.lines=5}
# list the sheets in sample.xls

```

```{r import55-solution}
excel_sheets('/datasets/sample.xls')
```

## Read Sheet

<hr>

Great! Now that we know how many sheets are present in the `sample.xls` file 
and their respective names, it is time to read in some data. `read_excel()` 
reads data from `.xls` and `.xlsx` files. You may ask how does it know which 
sheet to read the data from. That's rigt! In addition to the file name, we 
have to specify the sheet name or position in the workbook. 

### Syntax

<hr> 

```{r import56-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE}
# specify sheet name
read_excel('folder_path/xyz.xls', sheet = 'first')

# specify sheet position
read_excel(folder_path/'xyz.xls', sheet = 1)
```

<br>

#### Instructions

- read the first sheet in the `sample.xls` file
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`

<hr>

```{r import56, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Read Sheets', exercise.lines=5}
# read the first sheet in sample.xls


```

```{r import56-solution}
read_excel('/datasets/sample.xls', sheet = 1)
```

## Read Specific Cells

<hr>

Alright! We now know how to read data from an excel sheet but we may not want 
to read all the data present in the sheet i.e. sometimes we might want to read 
a subset of the data (few rows of specific colums). In order to read a subset 
of data, we need to specify the associated rows and columns. For example, to 
read data from first 4 rows of columns **B** and **C**, we will specify 
`"B1:C4"` using the `range` argument. The input for the range must be enclosed 
in single/double quotes.

<br>

```{r import59-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE}
read_excel('folder_path/xyz.xls', sheet = 1, range = "B1:C4")
```

<br>

#### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from the file `sample.xls`
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`
- read the first 5 rows of columns **A**, **B** and **C**

```{r import59, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Read Specific Cells', exercise.lines=5}

```

```{r import59-solution}
read_excel('/datasets/sample.xls', sheet = 1, range = "A1:C5")
```

## Read Specific Cells

<hr>

There is another way to specify the subset of data that we might want to read. 
This approach includes specifying the following:

- specify a cell to start with (say A3)
- number of rows from to read including row 3
- number of columns to read including column A

The `range` argument is used to specify the cell but in this approach instead of 
directly specifying the cells, we will use `anchored()` to specify the initial 
cell and the number of rows and columns to read. It takes two arguments:

- `anchor`: the initial cell (say "A3")
- `dim`: the number of rows and columns as a vector (c(3, 2) for 3 rows and 2 columns)

## Read Specific Cells

<hr>

### Syntax

<hr>

```{r import61-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE,  collapse=FALSE}
read_excel('/datasets/sample.xls', sheet = 1, col_names = FALSE,
  range = anchored("A3", dim = c(3, 2)))
```

#### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from the file `sample.xls`
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`
- read data from 4th to 7th row of columns A & B

```{r import61, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Read Specific Cells',  exercise.lines=5}



```

```{r import61-solution}
read_excel('/datasets/sample.xls', sheet = 1, col_names = FALSE,
  range = anchored("A4", dim = c(3, 2)))
```

## Read Specific Cells 

<hr>

There is another way to specify the subset of data that we might want to read. 
This approach includes specifying the following:

- specify a cell to start with (say A3)
- number of rows from to read including row 3
- number of columns to read including column A

The `range` argument is used to specify the cell but in this approach instead 
of directly specifying the cells, we will use `cell_limits()` to specify the 
initial cell and the number of rows and columns to read. It takes two arguments:

<br>

## Read Specific Cells 

<hr>

### Syntax

<hr>

```{r import74-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE,  collapse=FALSE}
read_excel('/datasets/sample.xls', sheet = 1,
  range = cell_limits(c(1, 1), c(6, 4)))
```

#### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from the file `sample.xls`
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`
- read data from rows 1 to 4 and columns 2 to 4

```{r import74, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Read Specific Cells',  exercise.lines=5}



```

```{r import74-solution}
read_excel('/datasets/sample.xls', sheet = 1,
  range = cell_limits(c(1, 2), c(4, 4)))
```

## Read Specific Rows

<hr>

So far we have explored reading a subset of data i.e. certain rows and columns. 
In this section, we will read specific rows of all the columns form the excel 
sheet. We will continue to use the `range` argument and use `cell_rows()` to 
specify the rows from which to read the data. In the below example, we read 
data from the first 4 rows.

```{r import62-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE}
read_excel('/datasets/sample.xls', sheet = 1, range = cell_rows(1:4))
```

<br>

#### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from the file `sample.xls`
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`
- read data from rows 3 to 5

```{r import62, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Specify Rows',  exercise.lines=5}

```

```{r import62-solution}
read_excel('/datasets/sample.xls', sheet = 1, range = cell_rows(3:5))
```

## Read Specific Columns

<hr>

Let us look at another scenario where we want to read data all the rows but 
only specific columns. Use `cell_cols()` to specify the columns from which the 
data must be read. In the below example, we use `cell_cols()` to read data from 
columns 2 and 3. 

```{r import63-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE}
read_excel('/datasets/sample.xls', sheet = 1, range = cell_cols(2:3))
```

<br>

#### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from the file `sample.xls`
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`
- read data from columns 1 to 4

```{r import63, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Specify Columns',  exercise.lines=5}



```

```{r import63-solution}
read_excel('/datasets/sample.xls', sheet = 1, range = cell_cols(1:4))
```

## Other Softwares

<hr>

Sometimes, we might have to read data from files of other statistical softwares 
such as:

- SAS (.sas7bdat)
- SPSS (.sav)
- Stata (.dta)

In R, the following packages allow us to read data from the above file formats:

- [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/)
- [foreign](https://cran.r-project.org/package=foreign)
- [sas7bdat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=sas7bdat)

We will use the [haven](https://haven.tidyverse.org/) package in this tutorial.

## Stata

<hr>

Stata files have the extension `.dta` and can be read using either `read_dta()` 
or `read_stata()`.

<br>

#### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from `airline.dta` file
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`

```{r import68, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Read STATA File',  exercise.lines=5}
# read airline.dta file


```

```{r import68-solution}
read_stata('/datasets/airline.dta')  
```

## SPSS

<hr>

SPSS files have the extension `.sav` and can be read using either `read_sav()` 
or `read_spss()`.

<br>

#### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from `employee.sav` file
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`

```{r import71, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Read SPSS File',  exercise.lines=5}
# read employee.sav file


```

```{r import71-solution}
read_spss('/datasets/employee.sav')  
```

## SAS

<hr>

SAS files have the extension `.sas7bdat` and can be read using `read_sas()`.

<br>

#### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from `airline.sas7bdat` file
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`

```{r import73, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Read SAS File',  exercise.lines=5}
# read airline.sas7bdat file


```

```{r import73-solution}
read_sas('/datasets/airline.sas7bdat')
```
