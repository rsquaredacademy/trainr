## Introduction

<hr>

According to  a [survey](http://visit.crowdflower.com/rs/416-ZBE-142/images/CrowdFlower_DataScienceReport_2016.pdf) by [CrowdFlower](https://www.crowdflower.com/), data scientists spend most of their time cleaning and manipulating data rather than mining or modeling them for insights. As such, it becomes important to have tools that make data manipulation faster and easier. In this tutorial, we introduce you to [dplyr](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/), a grammar of data manipulation.

## dplyr Verbs

<hr>

dplyr provides a set of verbs that help us solve the most common data 
manipulation challenges while working with tabular data (dataframes, tibbles):

- `select`: returns subset of columns
- `filter`: returns a subset of rows
- `arrange`: re-order or arrange rows according to single/multiple variables
- `mutate`: create new columns from existing columns
- `summarise`: reduce data to a single summary


## Case Study

<hr>

We will explore a dummy data set that we have created to resemble web logs of 
an online retail company. We will use dplyr to answer the following questions:

- what is the average order value by device types?
- what is the average number of pages visited by purchasers and non-purchasers?
- what is the average time on site for purchasers vs non-purchasers?
- what is the average number of pages visited by purchasers and non-purchasers using mobile?


### Data

<hr>

```{r show, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ecom
```

### Data Dictionary

<hr>

Below is the description of the data set:

- referrer: referrer website/search engine
- device: device used to visit the website
- duration: time spent on the website (in seconds)
- n_pages: number of pages visited
- purchase: whether visitor purchased
- order_value: order value of visitor (in dollars)
- n_visit: number of visits


## Average Order Value

<hr>

**What is the average order value by device types?**

Average value of every order placed over a defined period of time. It is 
determined using sales per order and not sales per customer. Let us look at the 
steps to calculate AOV from the ecommerce data set.

<br>
<center>
![](/images/aov.png)
</center>
<br>

## AOV Computation

<hr>

- Step 1: Filter Purchasers
- Step 2: Select data related to AOV (order value) and device
- Step 3: Group order value and orders by device
- Step 4: Compute total order value and total orders
- Step 5: Compute AOV for each device
- Step 6: Select device and AOV data

<br>
<center>
![](/images/aov_flow_canva.png){width=100%}
</center>
<br>

## Filter 

<hr>

In order to compute the AOV, we must first separate the purchasers from 
non-purchasers. We will do this by filtering the data related to purchasers 
using the `filter()` function. It allows us to filter rows that meet a specific 
criteria/condition. The first argument is the name of the data frame and the 
rest of the arguments are expressions for filtering the data. Let us look at a 
few examples:

<br>
<center>
![](/images/filter_1.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

#### Syntax

```{r dplyr2-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
filter(data, filter_condition)
```

<br>

#### Instructions

<hr>

- filter all visits from mobile using `filter()`
- the first argument should be the data set i.e. `ecom`
- the next argument should be the condition for filtering which includes:
    - the column name (`device`)
    - the value based on which data must be filtered (`'mobile'`)
    - the equality operator (`==`)

```{r dplyr2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Filter - Part 1', exercise.lines = 5}
filter(ecom,  == )
```

```{r dplyr2-solution}
filter(ecom, device == "mobile")
```

<br>

### Multiple Filters

<hr>

<br>
<center>
![](/images/filter_2.png){width=90%}
</center>
</br>

#### Syntax

<hr>

```{r dplyr3-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
filter(data, condition1, condition2, ...)
```

<br>

#### Instructions

<hr>

- use `filter()` to filter visits from mobile which resulted in purchase
- the first argument should be the data set i.e. `ecom`
- you have to filter data using two columns which results in two conditions
- the first condition is the same as in the previous example
- the second condtion is related to `purchase` column
- when you filter based on a `logical` value, you just use the column
name when filtering for `TRUE` and `!` along with column name for `FALSE`
- since we are filtering observations which resulted in a purchase i.e. 
`purchase` column has value `TRUE`, we will just specify the column name

```{r dplyr3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Filter - Part 2'}
filter(ecom, , )
```

```{r dplyr3-solution}
filter(ecom, device == "mobile", purchase)
```

### Practice

<hr>

- use `filter()` to filter visits from mobile and browsed more than 5 pages (`n_pages`)
- the first argument should be the data set i.e. `ecom`
- the first condition must be same as the last two examples
- the second condition is related to the number of pages browsed; use the `>` operator
to compare the `n_pages` column to `5`

```{r dplyr4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Filter - Part 3', exercise.lines = 5}
filter(ecom, device == "mobile",       )
```

```{r dplyr4-solution}
filter(ecom, device == "mobile", n_pages > 5)
```

### Case Study

<hr>

- for our case study, we need to filter all visits that resulted in a purchase
- use `filter()` to filter observations where `purchase` column has the value `TRUE`

```{r dplyr5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Filter - Part 4'}
filter(ecom,            )
```

```{r dplyr5-solution}
filter(ecom, purchase)
```

## Select 

<hr>

After filtering the data, we need to select relevent variables to compute the 
AOV. Remember, we do not need all the columns in the data to compute a required 
metric (in our case, AOV). The `select()` function allows us to select a subset 
of columns. The first argument is the name of the data frame and the subsequent 
arguments specify the columns by name or position. Let us look at a few examples:

<br>
<center>
![](/images/select_1.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

#### Syntax

```{r dplyr6-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
select(data, column_name, column_name, ...)
```

<br>

#### Instructions

<hr>

- select the `device` and `purchase` column from `ecom`

```{r dplyr6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Select - Part 1', exercise.lines = 5}
select(ecom,     ,    )
```

```{r dplyr6-solution}
select(ecom, device, purchase)
```

<br>

### Select Multiple Columns

<hr>

<br>
<center>
![](/images/select_2.png){width=90%}
</center>
</br>

#### Syntax

```{r dplyr7-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
select(data, column_a:column_n)
```

<br>

#### Instructions

<hr>

- select all columns from `device` upto `purchase` 
- use `:` to specify the columns

```{r dplyr7, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Select - Part 2', exercise.lines = 5}
select(ecom,         )
```

```{r dplyr7-solution}
select(ecom, device:purchase)
```

### Exclude Columns

<hr>

<br>
<center>
![](/images/select_3.png){width=90%}
</center>
</br>

#### Syntax

<hr>

```{r dplyr8-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
select(data, -column_name, -column_name)
```

<br>

#### Instructions

<hr>

- select all columns from `ecom` except `device` and `n_pages`

```{r dplyr8, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Select - Part 3', exercise.lines = 5}
select(ecom,    ,     )
```

```{r dplyr8-solution}
select(ecom, -device, -n_pages)
```

### Case Study

<hr>

- select the following columns from `ecom`:
    - `device`
    - `order_value`


```{r dplyr9, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Select - Part 4', exercise.lines = 5}

```

```{r dplyr9-solution}
select(ecom, device, order_value)
```

- but we want the above data only for purchasers, combine `filter()` and 
`select()` functions to extract data related to purchasers


```{r dplyr10, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Select - Part 5', exercise.lines = 10}
# filter visits that related in a purchase
ecom1 <- filter(ecom,       )

# select device and order_value 
select(ecom1,      )
```

```{r dplyr10-solution}
ecom1 <- filter(ecom, purchase)
select(ecom1, device, order_value)
```

## Group Data 

<hr>

Since we want to compute the AOV for each device, we need to compute the total 
order value and total order items for each device. To achieve this, we will 
group the selected variables by device type. Using the `group_by()` function, 
we will group our case study data by device types. The first argument is the 
name of the data frame and the second argument is the name of the column based 
on which the data will be split. Let us look at a few examples:

### Syntax

<hr>

```{r dplyr11-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
group_by(data, grouping_variable)
```

### Instructions

<hr>

- use `group_by()` to group `ecom` by `referrer` 
- the first argument should be the name of the data set i.e. `ecom`
- the second argument should be the name of the grouping variable i.e. `referrer`

```{r dplyr11, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Group - Part 1', exercise.lines = 5}

```

```{r dplyr11-solution}
group_by(ecom, referrer)
```

### Case Study

<hr>

- use the `ecom2` data set
- use `group_by()` to group the data by device type i.e. `device` column
- we have provided the partial code, enter the name of the grouping variable

```{r dplyr12, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Group - Part 2', exercise.lines = 5}
ecom1 <- filter(ecom, purchase)
ecom2 <- select(ecom1, device, order_value)
group_by(ecom2,      )
```

```{r dplyr12-solution}
ecom1 <- filter(ecom, purchase)
ecom2 <- select(ecom1, device, order_value)
group_by(ecom2, device)
```

## Summarize 

<hr>

The next step is to compute the total order value and total order items for 
each device. We will use them to then compute the average order value. Now we 
need to reduce the order value and order items data to a single summary. We can 
achieve this using the `summarise()` function. The first argument is the name 
of a data frame and the subsequent arguments are functions that can generate a 
summary. For example, we can use `min`, `max`, `sum`, `mean` etc.


<br>
<center>
![](/images/groupby_summarise.png){width=90%}
</center>
</br>

Let us compute the average number of pages browsed by referrer type:

- split data by `referrer` type
- compute the average number of pages using `mean`


```{r sumeg, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
# split data by referrer type
step_1 <- group_by(ecom, referrer)

# compute average number of pages
summarise(step_1, mean(n_pages))
```

Now let us compute both the `mean` and the `median`.

```{r sumeg2, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
# split data by referrer type
step_1 <- group_by(ecom, referrer)

# compute average number of pages
summarise(step_1, mean(n_pages), median(n_pages))
```

Another way to achieve the above result is to use the 
`summarise_all()` function. How does that work? It generates the specified 
summary for all the columns in the data set except for the column based on 
which the data has been grouped or split. So we need to ensure that the data 
does not have any irrelevant columns.

- split data by `referrer` type
- select `order_value`
- compute the average number of pages by applying the `mean` function to all 
the columns


```{r sumall_eg, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
# select relevant columns
step_1 <- select(ecom, referrer, order_value)

# split data by referrer type
step_2 <- group_by(step_1, referrer)

# compute average number of pages
summarise_all(step_2, funs(mean))
```

Let us compute `mean` and `median` number of pages for each referre type using 
`summarise_all`.

```{r sumall_eg2, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
# select relevant columns
step_1 <- select(ecom, referrer, order_value)

# split data by referrer type
step_2 <- group_by(step_1, referrer)

# compute mean and median number of pages
summarise_all(step_2, funs(mean, median))
```


### Case Study

- use the `ecom3` data set
- use `summarise()` to compute the sum of order value and count of orders  
- use `sum()` and `n()` to generate the sum of the values and to count orders

```{r dplyr13, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Summarize', exercise.lines = 5}
ecom1 <- filter(ecom, purchase)
ecom2 <- select(ecom1, device, order_value)
ecom3 <- group_by(ecom2, device)
summarise(ecom3, revenue = , orders = )

```

```{r dplyr13-solution}
ecom1 <- filter(ecom, purchase)
ecom2 <- select(ecom1, device, order_value)
ecom3 <- group_by(ecom2, device)
summarise(ecom3, revenue = sum(order_value), orders = n())
```

- use the `ecom3` data set
- use `summarise_all()` and `funs()` to reproduce the above result

```{r dplyr14, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Summarize All', exercise.lines = 5}
ecom1 <- filter(ecom, purchase)
ecom2 <- select(ecom1, device, order_value)
ecom3 <- group_by(ecom2, device)
summarise_all(ecom3, funs(revenue = , orders = ))
```

```{r dplyr14-solution}
ecom1 <- filter(ecom, purchase)
ecom2 <- select(ecom1, device, order_value)
ecom3 <- group_by(ecom2, device)
summarise_all(ecom3, funs(revenue = sum, orders = n()))
```

## Mutate

<hr>

Now that we have the total order value and total order items for each device 
category, we can compute the AOV. We will create a new column to store the 
result. To create a new column, we will use the `mutate()` function. The first 
argument is the name of the data frame and the subsequent arguments are 
expressions for creating new columns based out of existing columns.

<br>
<center>
![](/images/mutate_1.png){width=90%}
</center>
</br>

Let us add a new column `avg_page_time` i.e. time on site divided by number of
pages visited.

```{r mutateg, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# select duration and n_pages from ecom
mutate_1 <- select(ecom, n_pages, duration)
mutate(mutate_1, avg_page_time = duration / n_pages)
```

We can create new columns based on other columns created using `mutate`. Let us 
create another column `sqrt_avg_page_time` i.e. square root of the average time
on page using `avg_page_time`.

```{r mutateg2, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
mutate(mutate_1,
       avg_page_time = duration / n_pages,
       sqrt_avg_page_time = sqrt(avg_page_time))
```

### Case Study

<hr>

- from the last step we have the total order value and total orders for each 
device category 
- use the `ecom4` data set
- create a new column `AOV` using `mutate()`  
- divide `revenue` by `orders` to arrive at the average order value for each 
device category

### Instructions

<hr>

```{r dplyr15, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Mutate', exercise.lines = 5}
ecom1 <- filter(ecom, purchase)
ecom2 <- select(ecom1, device, order_value)
ecom3 <- group_by(ecom2, device)
ecom4 <- summarise_all(ecom3, funs(revenue = sum, orders = n()))
mutate(ecom4, aov =                          )

```

```{r dplyr15-solution}
ecom1 <- filter(ecom, purchase)
ecom2 <- select(ecom1, device, order_value)
ecom3 <- group_by(ecom2, device)
ecom4 <- summarise_all(ecom3, funs(revenue = sum, orders = n()))
mutate(ecom4, aov = revenue / orders)
```

## Arrange Data

<hr>

Arranging data in ascending or descending order is one of the most common tasks
in data manipulation. We can use `arrange` to arrange data by different columns.


<br>
<center>
![](/images/arrange_1.png){width=90%}
</center>
</br>

### Syntax

<hr>

```{r arrange-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
arrange(data, column_name)
```

Let us say we want to arrange data by the number of pages browsed.

```{r arrange_eg, eval= TRUE, echo=TRUE}
arrange(ecom, n_pages)
```

If we want to arrange the data in descending order, we can use `desc()`. Let us 
arrange the data in descending order.

```{r arrange_eg2, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
arrange(ecom , desc(n_pages))
```

Data can be arranged by multiple variables as well. Let us arrange data first by 
number of visits and then by number of pages in a descending order.

```{r arrange_eg3, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
arrange(ecom, n_visit, desc(n_pages))
```

### Case Study

<hr>

- use the `ecom6` data set
- sort the `aov` column in ascending order using `arrange()`

```{r arrange4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Arrange', exercise.lines = 12}
ecom1 <- filter(ecom, purchase)
ecom2 <- select(ecom1, device, order_value)
ecom3 <- group_by(ecom2, device)
ecom4 <- summarise_all(ecom3, funs(revenue = sum, orders = n()))
ecom5 <- mutate(ecom4, aov = revenue / orders)
ecom6 <- select(ecom5, device, aov)

# sort aov in ascending order

```

```{r arrange4-solution}
ecom1 <- filter(ecom, purchase)
ecom2 <- select(ecom1, device, order_value)
ecom3 <- group_by(ecom2, device)
ecom4 <- summarise_all(ecom3, funs(revenue = sum, orders = n()))
ecom5 <- mutate(ecom4, aov = revenue / orders)
ecom6 <- select(ecom5, device, aov)

# sort aov in ascending order
arrange(ecom6, aov)
```

## AOV by Devices

<hr>

Let us combine all the code from the previous steps:

```{r dplyr17, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ecom1 <- filter(ecom, purchase)
ecom2 <- select(ecom1, device, order_value)
ecom3 <- group_by(ecom2, device)
ecom4 <- summarise_all(ecom3, funs(revenue = sum, orders = n()))
ecom5 <- mutate(ecom4, aov = revenue / orders)
ecom6 <- select(ecom5, device, aov)
ecom6
```

<br>

### Using Pipe 

<hr>

If you observe, at each step we create a new variable(data frame) and then use 
it as an input in the next step i.e. the output from one function becomes the 
input for another function. Can we achieve the final outcome i.e. `ecom6` 
without creating the intermediate data frames (ecom1 - ecom5)? Yes, we can. We 
will use the `%>%` operator to chain the above steps so that we can avoid 
creating the intermediate data frames. Let us see how to do that.

```{r dplyr18, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
ecom %>%
  filter(purchase) %>%
  select(device, order_value) %>%
  group_by(device) %>%
  summarise_all(funs(revenue = sum, orders = n())) %>%
  mutate(
    aov = revenue / orders
  ) %>%
  select(device, aov)
```

<br>

In the above code, we take the output from each step and use it as an input for 
the next step using the pipe `%>%` operator. It reduces the intermediate data 
frames and makes the code readable. Take the `ecom` data frame `->` filter the 
purchasers `->` select device, order_value and order_items variables `->` group 
the resulting data frame by device type `->` compute the sum of all the 
variables in the grouped data frames `->` compute the average order value `->` 
select device type and aov


It is the same as the steps we wrote at the beginning of this module. Now you 
realize how powerful dplyr is along with the `%>%` operator. There are other 
functions in dplyr but we will cover them in another module. You are encouraged 
to use the above approach to answer the questions we have listed below.

## Practice Questions

<hr>

- what is the average number of pages visited by purchasers and non-purchasers?
- what is the average time on site for purchasers vs non-purchasers?
- what is the average number of pages visited by purchasers and non-purchasers using mobile?
