## Introduction

<hr>

In this tutorial, we will learn to combine tables using different `*_join` 
functions provided in dplyr. Let us assume we have 2 tables **x** and **y**. 

The following types of `join` functions are provided in dplyr:

- `inner_join()`
- `left_join()`
- `right_join()`
- `semi_join()`
- `anti_join()`
- `full_join()`


## Case Study

<br>

We have two data sets with details of customers and their orders. We will use 
the join functions of dplyr to combine the data sets in different ways to glean 
information about customer orders. 

We will explore the following in the case study:

- details of customers who have placed orders and their order details
- details of customers and their orders irrespective of whether a customer has 
placed orders or not
- customer details for each order
- details of customers who have placed orders
- details of customers who have not placed orders
- details of all customers and all orders

## Data

### Orders

<hr>

```{r dplyr2, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
order
```

### Customers

<hr>

```{r dplyr, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
customer
```

## Example Data

## Inner Join

<hr>

<br>
<center>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/draw_inner.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

`inner_join()` returns all rows from x where there are matching values in y, 
and all columns from x and y. If there are multiple matches between x and y, 
all combination of the matches are returned.

### Instructions

<hr>

- use `inner_join()` to get details of customers who have placed orders and 
their order details

```{r dplyr3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Inner Join'}

```

```{r dplyr3-solution}
inner_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Left Join

<hr>

`left_join()` returns all rows from x, and all columns from x and y. Rows in x 
with no match in y will have NA values in the new columns. If there are 
multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches are returned.

<br>

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/draw_left.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

### Instructions

<hr>

- use `left_join()` to get details of customers and their orders irrespective 
of whether a customer has placed orders or not

```{r dplyr4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Left Join'}

```

```{r dplyr4-solution}
left_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Right Join

<hr>

`right_join()` returns all rows from y, and all columns from x and y. Rows in y 
with no match in x will have NA values in the new columns. If there are 
multiple matches between x and y, all combinations of the matches are returned.

<br>
<center>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/draw_right.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

### Instructions

<hr>

- use `right_join()` to get customer details for each order

```{r dplyr5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Right Join'}

```

```{r dplyr5-solution}
right_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Semi Join

<hr>

`semi_join()` returns all rows from x where there are matching values in y, 
keeping just columns from x. A semi join differs from an inner join because an 
inner join will return one row of x for each matching row of y, where a semi 
join will never duplicate rows of x.

</center>
<br>

### Instructions

<hr>

- use `semi_join()` to get details of customers who have placed orders

```{r dplyr6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Semi Join'}

```

```{r dplyr6-solution}
semi_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Anti Join

<hr>

`anti_join()` returns all rows from x where there are not matching values in y, 
keeping just columns from x.

<br>
<center>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/draw_anti.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

### Instructions

<hr>

- use `anti_join()` to get details of customers who have not placed orders

```{r dplyr7, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Anti Join'}

```

```{r dplyr7-solution}
anti_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```

## Full Join

<hr>

`full_join()` returns all rows and all columns from both x and y. Where there 
are not matching values, returns NA for the one missing.

<br>
<center>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/draw_full.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

### Instructions

<hr>

- use `full_join()` to get details of all customers and all orders

```{r dplyr8, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Full Join'}

```

```{r dplyr8-solution}
full_join(customer, order, by = "id")
```
