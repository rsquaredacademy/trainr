## Introduction

<hr>

In this module, we will learn to work with string data in R using [stringr](http://stringr.tidyverse.org). As we did in the earlier modules, we will use a case study to explore the various features of the stringr package. You can
download the data for the case study from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/master/mock_strings.csv) or directly import the data using the readr package.  Let us begin by installing and loading stringr and a set of other pacakges we will be using.


## Case Study

### Introduction

<hr>

- extract domain name from random email ids
- extract image type from url
- extract image dimension from url
- extract extension from domain name
- extract http protocol from url
- extract domain name from url
- extract extension from url
- extract file type from url


## Data

<hr>

```{r show, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Data'}
mockstring
```

## Sample Data

<hr>

Since the data set has 1000 rows, we will use a smaller sample for better
readability.

```{r sample, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Sample Data'}
mockdata <- 
mockdata
```

```{r sample-solution}
mockdata <- slice(mockstring, 1:10)
mockdata
```

## Detect @

<hr>

![](/images/str_detect.png){width=90%}

## Detect @

<hr>

One of the columns in the case study data is `email`. It contains random email 
ids. We want to ensure that the email ids adher to a particular format .i.e

- they contain `@`
- they contain only one `@`

Let us first detect if the email ids contain `@`. Use `str_detect()` to detect 
`@`.


```{r detect, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Detect'}

```

```{r detect-solution}
str_detect(mock_data$email, pattern = "@")
```

## Count @

<hr>

![](/images/str_count.png){width=90%}

## Count @

<hr>

Use `str_count()` to count the number of times `@` appears in the email ids.

```{r count, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Count'}

```

```{r count-solution}
str_count(mock_data$email, pattern = "@")
```

## Concatenate

<hr>

![](/images/str_c.png){width=90%}

## Concatenate

<hr>

We can use `str_c()` to concatenate strings. Let us add the string `email id:` 
before each email id in the data set.

```{r concatenate, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Concatenate'}

```

```{r concatenate-solution}
str_c("email id:", mock_data$email)
```

## Split

<hr>

![](/images/str_split.png){width=90%}

## Split

<hr>

If we want to split a string into two parts using a particular pattern, we use 
`str_split()`. Let us split the domain name and extension from the domain 
column in the data. The domain name and extension are separated by `.` and we 
will use it to split the domain column. Since `.` is a special character, we 
will use two slashes to escape the special character. 

```{r split, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Split'}

```

```{r split-solution}
str_split(mock_data$email, pattern = "@")
```

## Truncate

We can truncate a string using `str_trunc()`. The default truncation happens at 
the beggining of the string but we can truncate the central part or the end of 
the string as well. 

```{r trunc, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Truncate Strings'}
str_trunc(mockdata$email, width = 10)
str_trunc(mockdata$email, width = 10, side = "left")
str_trunc(mockdata$email, width = 10, side = "center")
```

```{r trunc-solution}
str_split(mock_data$email, pattern = "@")
```

## Sort

<hr>

![](/images/str_sort.png){width=90%}

## Sort

<hr>

Strings can be sorted using `str_sort()`. Let us quickly sort the emails in 
both ascending and descending orders.

```{r sort, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Sort'}

```

```{r sort-solution}
str_sort(mock_data$email)
```

## Sort

<hr>

![](/images/str_sort_descending.png){width=90%}

## Sort

<hr>

```{r sort2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Sort - Descending'}

```

```{r sort2-solution}
str_sort(mock_data$email, descending = TRUE)
```

## Case

<hr>

![](/images/str_to_upper.png){width=90%}

## Case

<hr>

The case of a string can be changed to upper, lower or title case as shown 
below.

```{r case, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Change Case'}

```

```{r case-solution}
str_to_upper(mockdata$full_name)
str_to_lower(mockdata$full_name)
```

## Replace

<hr>

![](/images/str_replace.png){width=90%}

## Replace

<hr>

Parts of a string can be replaced using `str_replace()`. In the `address` 
column of the data set, let us replace:

- Street with ST
- Road with RD

```{r replace, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Replace'}



```

```{r replace-solution}
str_replace(mockdata$address, "Street", "ST")
str_replace(mockdata$address, "Road", "RD")
```

## Extract

<hr>

![](/images/str_extract.png){width=90%}

## Extract

<hr>

We can extract parts of the string that match a particular pattern using 
`str_extract()`.

```{r extract, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Extract'}

```

```{r extract-solution}
str_extract(mock_data$email, pattern = "org")
```

## Match

<hr>

![](/images/str_match.png){width=90%}

## Match

<hr>

Before we extract, we need to know whether the string contains text that match 
our pattern. Use `str_match()` to see if the pattern is present in the string.

```{r match, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Match'}

```

```{r match-solution}
str_match(mock_data$email, pattern = "org")
```

## Index

<hr>

![](/images/str_which.png){width=90%}

## Index

<hr>

If we are dealing with a character vector and know that the pattern we are 
looking at is present in the vector, we might want to know the index of the 
strings in which it is present. Use `str_which()` to identify the index of 
the strings that match our pattern.

```{r which, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Index'}

```

```{r which-solution}
str_which(mock_data$email, pattern = "org")
```

## Locate

<hr>

![](/images/str_locate.png){width=90%}

## Locate

<hr>

Another objective might be to locate the position of the pattern we are looking 
for in the string. For example, if we want to know the position of `@`  in the 
email ids, we can use `str_locate()`.

```{r locate, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Locate'}

```

```{r locate-solution}
str_locate(mock_data$email, pattern = "com")
```

## Length

<hr>

![](/images/str_length.png){width=90%}

## Length

<hr>

The length of the string can be computed using `str_length()`. Let us ensure 
that the length of the strings in the `password` column is 16.

```{r length, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Length'}

```

```{r length-solution}
str_length(mockdata$passwords)
```

## Extract

<hr>

![](/images/str_sub.png){width=90%}

## Extract

<hr>

We can extract parts of a string by specifying the starting and ending position 
using `str_sub()`. Let us extract the currency type from the `currency` column.

```{r sub, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Extract'}

```

```{r sub-solution}
str_sub(mock_data$currency, start = 1, end = 1)
```

## Word

![](/images/word.png){width=90%}

## Word

<hr>

One final function that we will look at before the case study is `word()`. It 
extracts word(s) from sentences. We do not have any sentences in the data set, 
but let us use it to extract the first and last name from the `full_name` 
column.

```{r word, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Word'}

```

```{r word-solution}
word(mock_data$full_name, 1)
```
