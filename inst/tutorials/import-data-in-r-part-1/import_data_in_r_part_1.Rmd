## Introduction

<hr>

Importing or reading data from different sources and file formats is one of the
basic and crucial stages of any data analysis project. In this tutorial, you 
will learn to read data into R, examine the different challenges and address
them using the appropriate methods.

### What will I learn?

<hr>

- read data from flat/delimited files
- handle column names/file header
- skip text/info in files
- specify column/variable data types
- read subset of columns/variables

## File Types

<hr>

Before we start reading data from different files, let us take a quick look at
the different types of delimiters we have to deal with while reading or 
importing data.

<br>

#### Comma Separated Values

<br>

<br>

#### Semi Colon Separated Values

<br>

<br>

<br>

#### Space Separated Values

<br>
![](/images/mtcars_space.png){width=60%}
<br>

<br>

#### Tab Separated Values

<br>
![](/images/mtcars_tab.png){width=60%}
<br>

## Read Data

<hr>

Let us read data from a csv (comma separated values) file and explore the 
options listed in the previous section. To read a file named `xyz.csv`, you 
will do the following i.e. use `read_csv()` and specify the path to the 
folder/directory where the file resides.

```{r import2-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE}
read_csv('folder_path/xyz.csv')
```

<br>

### Instructions

<hr>

- read the file `hsb2.csv` 
- specify the path of the directory as `/datasets/`
- the directory path and the file name must be separated by `/`


```{r import2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Introduction', exercise.lines=5}
# read data


```

```{r import2-solution}
read_csv('/datasets/hsb2.csv')
```

Sometimes you may get an error while reading data from a file(which most of us 
see when we are trying to read data for the first time), follow the below 
instructions:

- check the separator in the file and ensure it is a `comma`
- check the file name
- check the file path i.e. location of the file
- ensure that the file name or path is enclosed in single or double quotes

## Column Names

<hr>

In some cases, files do not include column names or headers. If we do not 
indicate the absence of column names, `readr` will treat the first row from 
th data as the column name. Like we said before, it is a good practice to take 
a quick look at the data to check for the presence/absence of column names.

#### Column names are present

<br>
![](/images/mtcars_comma.png){width=60%}
<br>
<br>

#### Column names are absent

<br>
![](/images/mtcars_column_false.png){width=60%}
<br>

## Column Names

<hr>

Use `col_names` to indicate whether the data includes column names. It takes 
two values, `TRUE` and `FALSE`. If set to `FALSE`, readr will generate column 
names. The below code reads data from a file which does not have column names 
present in the first row.

```{r import1-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE}
read_csv('directory_path/file_name.csv', col_names = FALSE)
```

<br>

### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from `hsb3.csv` 
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`
- <a href="https://github.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/blob/master/hsb2.csv" target="_blank">click here</a> to check if the file has column names
- if column names are absent, indicate it while reading data

```{r import1, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Column Names', exercise.lines=5}
# read data


```

```{r import1-solution}
read_csv('/datasets/hsb3.csv', col_names = FALSE)
```

## Column Names

<hr>

We learnt how to indicate whether file includes column names or not. What if we 
want to specify names for the columns while reading data from the file. 
`col_names` can be used to specify column names as well. All that we need to do 
is to store the names as a character vector and supply it to `col_names`. 
Assume you are reading data from a file and need to specify column names, the 
below example shows how to do it.

```{r import4eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE}
column_names <- c('col_1', 'col_2', 'col_3')
read_csv('directory_path/file_name.csv', col_names = column_names)
```

<br>

### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from `hsb3.csv` 
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`
- use `cnames` provided below to specify the column names 

```{r import4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Column Names', exercise.lines=5}
# column names
cnames <- c("id", "female", "race", "ses", "schtyp", "prog", "read", "write", "math", "science", "socst")

# read data


```

```{r import4-solution}
cnames <- c("id", "female", "race", "ses", "schtyp", "prog", "read", "write", "math", "science", "socst")
read_csv('//home//hebbali_aravind//datasets//hsb3.csv', col_names = cnames)
```

## Skip Lines

<hr>

In certain files, you will find information related to the data such as:

- the data source
- column names
- column description
- copyright etc.

The data will appear after/below such text/information. While reading data from
such files, we need to skip all the rows where the text is present. If we do 
not skip them, `readr` will consider them as part of the data.

<br>
![](/images/mtcars_skip.png){width=80%}
<br>

## Skip Lines

<hr>

If the file has contents other than data in the first few lines, we need to 
skip them before reading the data. Use `skip` to skip a certain number of 
lines. For example, the below example shows how to skip the first 5 lines of a 
file.

```{r import8-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE}
read_csv('directory_path/file_name.csv', skip = 5)
```

<br>

### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from `hsb4.cv` file
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`
- <a href="https://github.com/rsquaredacademy/datasets/blob/master/hsb4.csv" target="_blank">click here</a> to check if the file has any text/info before data
- if any text/info is present before data, count the number of rows covered by 
the text
- use `skip` argument to skip the text/info and read from the row where the 
column names are present

```{r import8, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Skip Lines', exercise.lines=5}
# read data after skipping the required number of rows


```

```{r import8-solution}
read_csv('/datasets/hsb4.csv', skip = 3)
```

## Maximum Lines 

<hr>

Suppose the data file contains several thousands of rows of data and we do not 
want to read all of it. What can we do in such cases? `readr` allows us to 
specify the maximum number of rows to be read using the `n_max` argument.
Suppose we want to read only 100 rows of data from a file, we can set `n_max` 
equal to 100. 

```{r import5-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE}
read_csv('directory_path/file_name.csv', n_max = 100)
```

<br>

### Instructions

<hr>

- read the first 120 rows from the `hsb2.csv` file
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`
- observe the last row in the output and check if it says `# ... with 110 more 
rows`

```{r import5, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Maximum Lines', exercise.lines=5}
# read the first 120 rows of data


```

```{r import5-solution}
read_csv('/datasets/hsb2.csv', n_max = 120)
```

## Column Specification

<hr>

If you observed the output when we read data in the previous tab, it includes 
the data type detected for each column in the file. When you read data using 
readr, it will display the data type detected for each column/variable in the 
data set. If you want to check the data types before reading the data, use 
`spec_csv()`. We will learn to specify the column types in the next section.

<br>

### Instructions

<hr>

- run the below code and observe the output

```{r import3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Introduction', message = FALSE, exercise.lines=5}
spec_csv('/datasets/hsb2.csv')
```

## Column Types 

<hr>

If you have observed carefully, when you read data using `readr`, it displays
the column names and column types followed by the first 10 rows of data. 
`readr` determines the data type for each column based on the first 1000 rows 
of data. The data can be of the following types:

- integer
- double (decimal point)
- logical (TRUE/FALSE)
- character (text/string)
- factor (categorical/qualitative)
- date/time

- date/time

## Column Types

<hr>

Before you read data from a file, use `spec_csv()` to see the data types as 
determined by `readr`. If it determines the data types correctly, you can go
ahead and read the data else we will have to specify the data types and we 
will have to do that for all the columns we want to read and not just for 
those columns whose data type was wrongly determined by `readr`.

To specify the data types, we will use the `col_types` argument and supply it
a list of data types. The data types can be specified using:

- `col_integer()`
- `col_double()`
- `col_factor()`
- `col_logical()`
- `col_character()`
- `col_date()`
- `col_time()`
- `col_datetime()`

While specifying the data types we also need to specify the categories of the 
categorical/qualitative variable. To do that, we use the `levels` argument 
within `col_factor()`. Let us read data from the `mtcars5.csv` file to understand
data type specification.

```{r import6-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE}
read_csv('/datasets/mtcars5.csv', col_types = list(
        col_double(), col_factor(levels = c(4, 6, 8)),
        col_double(), col_integer()))
```                          

### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from `hsb2.csv` file
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`
- specify the column types for each column in the file

```{r import6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Column Types', exercise.lines=5}
# read data while specifying column types


```

```{r import6-solution}
read_csv('/datasets/hsb2.csv', col_types = list(
  col_integer(), col_factor(levels = c(0, 1)), 
  col_factor(levels = c(1, 2, 3, 4)), col_factor(levels = c(1, 2, 3)), 
  col_factor(levels = c(1, 2)), col_factor(levels = c(1, 2, 3)),
  col_integer(), col_integer(), col_integer(), col_integer(),
  col_integer())            
)
```

## Specific Columns

<hr>

We may not always want to read all the columns from a file. In such cases, we 
can specify the columns to be read using `col_types` argument and supplying to 
it the names of the columns to be read. We will use `cols_only()` to specify 
the column names and their respective data types.

```{r import7-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE}
read_csv('/datasets/mtcars5.csv', col_types = cols_only(
        mpg = col_double(), cyl = col_factor(levels = c(4, 6, 8))))
```

<br>

### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from `hsb2.csv` file
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`
- read the following columns only
    - id
    - prog
    - read

```{r import7, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Read Specific Columns', exercise.lines=5}
# read columns id, prog and read from hsb2.csv



```

```{r import7-solution}
read_csv('/datasets/hsb2.csv', col_types = cols_only(id = col_integer(),
  prog = col_factor(levels = c(1, 2, 3)), read = col_integer())
)
```

## Skip Columns

<hr>

Sometimes we may want to skip some columns while reading data i.e. suppose we 
have 10 columns and we want to read only 8 columns. In such cases, we can use 
`cols_skip()` to specify the columns that must be skipped while reading the 
data.

```{r import9-eg, echo=TRUE, eval=FALSE, collapse=FALSE}
read_csv('/datasets/mtcars5.csv', col_types = list(
        col_double(), col_factor(levels = c(4, 6, 8)),
        col_skip(), col_integer()))
```

<br>

### Instructions

<hr>

- read data from `hsb5.csv` file
- the path of the directory is `/datasets/`
- skip the following columns
    - id
    - prog
    - read

```{r import9, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Skip Columns', exercise.lines=5}
# read columns id, prog and read from hsb2.csv



```

```{r import9-solution}
read_csv('/datasets/hsb2.csv', col_types = cols_only(id = col_integer(),
  prog = col_factor(levels = c(1, 2, 3)), read = col_integer())
)
```


## Summary

<hr>

<br>
<center>
![](/images/import_func.png){width=60%}
</center>
<br>

The above table gives an overview of the functions for reading different types 
of files in readr and Base R. All the functions in readr offer a common set of 
options which are described below: 

- `col_names`: whether data includes column names
- `n_max`: maximum number of lines/rows to read
- `col_types`: data type of the columns
- `skip`: number of lines/rows to skip

## Practice 

<hr>

- check the separator type in the following files and read them using appropriate `read_xxx()` function:

    - `hsb.csv`
    - `mtcars.tsv`
    - `hsb1.csv`
    - `hsb.txt`
