```

## Introduction

<hr>

In this module, we will learn to work with date/time data in R using [lubridate]( https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=lubridate){target="_blank"}, an R package that makes it easy to work with dates and time. 

### What will I learn?

<hr>

- extract date and time components
- date arithmetic
- compute time interval and duration

## Origin

<hr>

Let us look at the origin for the numbering system used for date and time calculations in R.

```{r origin, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
lubridate::origin
```

## Current Date/Time

<hr>

Next, let us check out the current date, time and whether it occurs in the am or 
pm. `now()` returns the date, time as well as the time zone whereas `today()` 
will return only the current date. `am()` and `pm()` return TRUE or FALSE.

```{r today, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
now()
today()
am(now())
pm(now())
```

## Data

<hr>

```{r show, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
transact
```

<br>

### Data Dictionary

<hr>

The data set has 3 columns. All the dates are in the format (yyyy-mm-dd).

- Invoice: invoice date 
- Due: due date
- Payment: payment date

## Case Study

<hr>

We will use the functions in the lubridate package to answer a few questions 
we have about the transact data.

- extract date, month and year from Due
- compute the number of days to settle invoice
- compute days over due
- check if due year is a leap year
- check when due day in february is 29, whether it is a leap year
- how many invoices were settled within due date
- how many invoices are due in each quarter
- what is the average duration between invoice date and payment date

## Extract Date, Month & Year 

<hr>

The first thing we will learn is to extract the date, month and year. Let us 
now extract the date, month and year from the `Due` column.

<br>
<center>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/day_week_month.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

### Example

<hr>

```{r lub18, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE, collapse=TRUE}
this_day <- as_date('2017-03-23')
day(this_day)
month(this_day)
year(this_day)
```

### Instructions

<hr>

- extract the following from the `Due` column of `transact` data:
    - `day`
    - `month`
    - `year`

```{r lub2, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study', exercise.lines = 8}
mutate(transact, 
  due_day   = ,
  due_month = ,
  due_year  = 
)
```

```{r lub2-solution}
mutate(transact,
  due_day   = day(Due),
  due_month = month(Due),
  due_year  = year(Due)
)
```

## Course Duration

<hr>

Time to do some arithmetic with the dates. Let us calculate the duration of a 
course by subtracting the course start date from the course end date. Let us 
estimate the number of days to settle the invoice by subtracting the date of 
invoice from the date of payment.

<br>
<center>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/course_duration.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>


```{r lub19, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
course_start    <- as_date('2017-04-12')
course_end      <- as_date('2017-04-21')
course_duration <- course_end - course_start
course_duration
```

### Instructions

<hr>

- compute the number of days to settle invoices using `Payment` and `Invoice`
column from `transact` data
- subtract the invoice date from the payment date

```{r lub3, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study', exercise.lines = 5}
mutate(transact,
  days_to_pay = 
)
```

```{r lub3-solution}
mutate(transact,
  days_to_pay = Payment - Invoice
)
```

## Case Study

<hr>

How many of the invoices were settled post the due date? We can find this by:

- subtracting the due date from the payment date
- counting the number of rows where delay < 0

### Instructions

<hr>

- compute the difference between due date and payment date using `Due` and 
`Payment` columns from `transact` data
- filter all rows where the value of delay is greater than 0
- use `tally()` to compute the number of invoices settled post due date

```{r lub4, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study', exercise.lines = 10}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    delay = 
  ) %>%
  filter() %>%
  
```

```{r lub4-solution}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    delay = Due - Payment
  ) %>%
  filter(delay < 0) %>%
  tally()
```

## Case Study

<hr>

Let us do some data sanitization. If the due day happens to be February 29, let 
us ensure that the due year is a leap year. Below are the steps to check if the 
due year is a leap year:

- we will extract the following from the due date:
    - day
    - month
    - year
- we will then create a new column is_leap which will have be set to TRUE if 
the year is a leap year else it will be set to FALSE
- filter all the payments due on 29th Feb
- select the following columns:
    - Due
    - is_leap

### Instructions

<hr>

- extract day, month and year from `Due` 
- check if `due_year` is a leap year using `leap_year()`
- select all columns except `Invoice` and `Payment`
- filter all rows where `due_month` is `2` and `due_day` is `29`

```{r lub6, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study', exercise.lines = 12}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    due_day   = ,
    due_month = ,
    due_year  = ,
    is_leap   = 
  ) %>%
  select() %>%
  filter()
```

```{r lub6-solution}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    due_day   = day(Due),
    due_month = month(Due),
    due_year  = year(Due),
    is_leap   = leap_year(due_year)
  ) %>%
  select(-(Invoice), -(Payment)) %>%
  filter(due_month == 2 & due_day == 29)
```

## Shift Date

<hr>

Time to shift some dates. We can shift a date by days, weeks or months.  

<br>
<center>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/shift_dates.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

### Syntax

<hr>

```{r lab40-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
date + days(number_of_days)
date + weeks(number_of_weeks)
date + years(number_of_years)
```

### Instructions

<hr>

- shift the course start date by:
    - 2 days
    - 3 weeks
    - 1 year

```{r lub40, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Shift Date', exercise.lines = 10}
# shift course start date by 2 days
course_start +

# shift course start date by 3 weeks
course_start +

# shift course start date by 1 year
course_start +
```

```{r lub40-solution}
course_start + days(2)
course_start + weeks(1)
course_start + years(1)
```


## Interval

<hr>

Let us calculate the duration of the course using `interval`. If you observe 
carefully, the result is not the duration in days but an object of class 
`interval`. Now let us learn how we can use intervals.

<br>
<center>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/course_interval.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

### Syntax

<hr>

```{r lub10-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
interval(start_date, end_date)
```

### Instructions

<hr>

- compute the course duration using `interval()`
- use `course_start` as the course start date
- use `course_end` as the course end date

```{r lub10, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Interval', exercise.lines = 5}



```

```{r lub10-solution}
interval(course_start, course_end)
```

## Shift Interval

<hr>

Intervals can be shifted too. In the below example, we shift the course interval by:

- 1 day
- 3 weeks
- 1 year

<br>
<center>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/shift_interval.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

### Syntax

<hr>

```{r lab50-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
int_shift(interval, by = days(number_of_days))
int_shift(interval, by = weeks(number_of_weeks))
int_shift(interval, by = years(number_of_years))
```

### Instructions

<hr>

We have created `course_interval` using the course start and end date. Use 
`int_shift()` to shift the `course_interval` by:

- `1 day`
- `3 weeks`
- `1 year`

```{r lab50, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Shifting Intervals', exercise.lines = 7}
course_interval <- interval(course_start, course_end)

```

```{r lab50-solution}
course_interval <- interval(course_start, course_end)
int_shift(course_interval, by = days(1))
int_shift(course_interval, by = weeks(3))
int_shift(course_interval, by = years(1))
```

## Intervals Overlap

<hr>

Let us say you are planning a vacation and want to check if the vacation dates 
overlap with the course dates. You can do this by:

- creating vacation and course intervals
- use `int_overlaps()` to check if two intervals overlap. It returns `TRUE` if 
the intervals overlap else `FALSE`.

<br>
<center>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/interval_overlap.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

### Syntax

<hr>

```{r lub60-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
int_overlaps(interval_1, interval_2)
```

### Instructions

<hr>

Let us use the vacation start and end dates to create `vacation_interval` and 
then check if it overlaps with `course_interval`:

- create `vacation_interval` using `vacation_start` and `vacation_end`
- use `interval()` to create `vacation_interval`
- test if `vacation_interval` overlaps with `course_interval` using `int_overlaps()`

```{r lub60, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Overlapping Intervals', exercise.lines = 6}
vacation_start    <- as_date('2017-04-19')
vacation_end      <- as_date('2017-04-25')
vacation_interval <- 

```

```{r lub60-solution}
vacation_start    <- as_date('2017-04-19')
vacation_end      <- as_date('2017-04-25')
vacation_interval <- interval(vacation_start, vacation_end)
int_overlaps(course_interval, vacation_interval)
```

## Case Study

<hr>

Let us use intervals to count the number of invoices that were settled within 
the due date. To do this, we will:

- create an interval for the invoice and due date
- create a new column due_next by incrementing the due date by 1 day
- another interval for due_next and the payment date 
- if the intervals overlap, the payment was made within the due date

### Instructions

<hr>

- compute the interval for the invoice date (`Invoice`) and due date (`Due`)
using `interval()` and store it in the variable `inv_due_interval`
- shift the due date by 1 day using `days()` and store the new due date in the
variable `due_next`
- create an interval for the new due date (`due_next`) and payment date (`Payment`)
using `interval()` and store it in the variable `due_pay_interval`
- check if the above two intervals overlap using `int_overlaps()` and store the 
result in the variable `overlaps`
- select the following columns
    - `Invoice`
    - `Due`
    - `Payment`
    - `Overlaps`

```{r lub7, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study', exercise.lines = 12}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = ,
    due_next         = ,
    due_pay_interval = ,
    overlaps         = 
  ) %>%
  select()
```

```{r lub7-solution}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = interval(Invoice, Due),
    due_next         = Due + days(1),
    due_pay_interval = interval(due_next, Payment),
    overlaps         = int_overlaps(inv_due_interval, due_pay_interval)
  ) %>%
  select(Invoice, Due, Payment, overlaps)
```

## Case Study

<hr>

Below we show another method to count the number of invoices paid within the 
due date. Instead of using days to change the due date, we use `int_shift` to 
shift it by 1 day.

```{r lub12, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
# using int_shift
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = interval(Invoice, Due),
    due_pay_interval = interval(Due, Payment),  
    due_pay_next     = int_shift(due_pay_interval, by = days(1)),
    overlaps         = int_overlaps(inv_due_interval, due_pay_next)
  ) %>%
  select(Invoice, Due, Payment, overlaps)
```

## Within

<hr>

Let us assume that we have to attend a conference in April 2017. Does it occur 
during the course duration? We can answer this using `%within%` which will 
return `TRUE` if a date falls within an interval.

<br>
<center>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/within.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

### Syntax

<hr>

```{r lub30-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
date %within% interval
```

### Instructions

<hr>

- check whether the conference date (`conference`) clashes with `course_interval`
using `%within%`

```{r lub30, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Within', exercise.lines = 5}
conference <- as_date('2017-04-15')

```

```{r lub30-solution}
conference <- as_date('2017-04-15')
conference %within% course_interval
```

## Case Study

<hr>

Let us use `%within%` to count the number of invoices that were settled within 
the due date. We will do this by:

- creating an interval for the invoice and due date
- check if the payment date falls within the above interval

### Instructions

<hr>

- create an interval (`inv_due_interval`) for the invoice date (`Invoice`) and
due date (`Due`) using `interval()`
- check if the payment date (`Payment`) occurs within the above interval using
`%within%` and store it in the variable `overlaps`
- and select the following columns:
    - `Due`
    - `Payment`
    - `overlaps`

```{r lub13, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Case Study', exercise.lines = 10}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = ,
    overlaps = 
  ) %>%
  select()
```

```{r lub13-solution}
transact %>%
  mutate(
    inv_due_interval = interval(Invoice, Due),
    overlaps = Payment %within% inv_due_interval
  ) %>%
  select(Due, Payment, overlaps)
```

## Quarter

<hr>

Let us check the quarter and the semester in which the course starts.

<br>
<center>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/quarter_semester.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

### Syntax

<hr>

```{r lub20-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
# extract quarter
quarter(date)

# extract quarter with year
quarter(date, with_year = TRUE)

# extract semester 
semester(date)  
```

### Instructions

<hr>

- extract the following from the course start date (`course_start`)
    - quarter
    - quarter with year
    - semester

```{r lub20, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Quarter & Semester', exercise.lines = 7}
course_start




```

```{r lub20-solution}
course_start
quarter(course_start)
quarter(course_start, with_year = TRUE)
semester(course_start)  
```

## Convert

<hr>

<br>

```{r lub11-syntax, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
interval / dseconds()
interval / dminutes()
interval / dhours()
interval / dweeks()
interval / dyears()
```

### Instructions

course_interval / 
course_interval / 
course_interval / 
course_interval / 
```

```{r lub11-solution}
course_interval / dseconds()
course_interval / dminutes()
course_interval / dhours()
course_interval / dweeks()
course_interval / dyears()
```

## Convert

<hr>

We can use `time_length()` to get the course interval in different units.

<br>
<center>
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rsquaredacademy-education/img/master/images/time_length.png){width=90%}
</center>
<br>

### Syntax

```{r lub16, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Convert Units', exercise.lines = 5}

```

```{r lub16-solution}
time_length(course_interval, unit = "seconds")
time_length(course_interval, unit = "minutes")
time_length(course_interval, unit = "hours")
```

## Convert

- use `as.period()` to get the course interval (`course_interval`) in the 
following units
    - seconds
    - minutes
    - hours

```{r lub17, exercise = TRUE, exercise.eval = FALSE, exercise.cap = 'Convert Units', exercise.lines = 5}
